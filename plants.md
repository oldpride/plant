    Chrysanthemum indicum vs Chrysanthemum Weed (mugwort)
    according to chatgpt
    Chrysanthemum indicum is a species of chrysanthemum, a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the Asteraceae family. Chrysanthemum weed, also known as mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), is an aggressive perennial weed that resembles cultivated chrysanthemums. Here are some ways they differ:
    Appearance
    Chrysanthemum indicum is a yellow single flower, while mugwort leaves have white hairs on the undersides.
    Spread
    Chrysanthemum indicum is widespread, ranging from Russia to Asia, Korea, China, and Europe. Mugwort spreads by rhizomes and is common in landscape plantings and turf.
    Toxicity
    Chrysanthemum indicum is poisonous to cats, dogs, rodents, and grazing animals. While it's not clear if mugwort is poisonous, it's best to avoid ingesting any part of the plant
